## Rationale
During COVID-19, it's hard to meet other people. Due to the frustration and ongoing boredom people may face, we have decided to create a web application for people from all around the world to chat and make new friends!

## Quick Start
### Setting up
1. Get a Google Maps API key by following the guide [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).  
    Remember to enable Maps JavaScript API in your Google Cloud Platform.
    
2. Clone the repo
   ``` cmd
   git clone https://github.com/HelloWorldHnR/HelloWorld.git
   ```

3. Install NPM packages for server
    ``` cmd
    npm install
    ```

4. Install NPM packages for client
    ``` cmd
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

5. Add a `.env` file in the client directory with your API
    ```
    REACT_APP_GMAPS_API = ENTER YOUR API
    ```
6. Setup your MongoDB Cloud database and get your MongoDB Atlas connection string

7. Add another `.env` file in your root directory with your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   ```
   MONGODB_ATLAS_URI = ENTER YOUR MONGODB CONNECTION STRING
   ```

### Usage
From the project root directory, run `npm run dev` in the command line to run the client and server concurrently in your local computer.
